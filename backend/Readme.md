First we need to install mongodb then we need to run a command
in cmd "mongod" which will start Mongo server.

If there are any issues we need to add a path variable in Env variables to run
'mongod' that path we need to add is bin folder of mongo db software.

# To run 
we need to type command
npm run dev

Which will run express js which will connect to mongodb server.
